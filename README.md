# Folder Organizer

This program uses the customtkinter python package to display a simple gui for the user to create a system of directories somewhere on their machine.

---

## How to Use

Once you download the project ZIP, extract all files and navigate to the dist folder. Run create_file_system.exe to execute the program.

This is what the gui should look like when it pops up:

Under each label is an entry box where you can input a value to change the current generation settings. After all entries are filled, you can generate the file system by clicking the associated button in the bottom-right corner.

### About

This is a project that one of my roommates wanted which I thought would be a good practice project.
