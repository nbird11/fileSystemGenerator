# Folder Organizer

This program uses the customtkinter python package to display a simple gui for the user to create a system of directories somewhere on their machine.

---

## How to Use

Once you download the project ZIP, extract all files and navigate to the dist folder. Run create_file_system.exe to execute the program. (You may have to modify security measures on your system to allow downloading executables from the internet.)

This is what the gui should look like when it pops up:

Under each label is an entry box where you can input a value to change the current generation settings. After all entries are filled, you can generate the file system by clicking the associated button in the bottom-right corner.

### About

This is my first project for a client, which was my roommate at the time. He realized that he was making a deep file system for his mechanical engineering class with directories for each of the 15 units throughout the course, so he hired me to build him a simple application that would do this for him.
